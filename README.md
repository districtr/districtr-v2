This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to build the image and run a container:

```
make
```

I recommend also installing the packages locally on your machine using [npm](https://nodejs.org/en) or pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm`). That will provide type hints, code completion, methods, etc., that don't appear to show up purely using Docker. 

Alternatively, run the development server without docker:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Monorepo

This repo is a monorepo of databsae and typescript modules. Here are the current workspace:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
