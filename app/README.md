This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Set up your development environment:

```bash
cp .env.dev .env.local && npm i
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the
file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to
automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your
feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details.

## End to End testing

We use Cypress to run end-to-end tests and load test local or Fly backends. We are still generating tests, which are tricky to get working for many canvas-based frontend interactions.

```bash
npm run cy:install
# then, to open testing suite
npm run cy:open
```

To load test, run:

```bash
sh app/scripts/load_test.sh
```

Note: This is not quite working with Docker/compose quite yet. You will need to run the `npm` and bash script from your host machine.
